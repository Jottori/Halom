## Automated Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Coverage Target**: 95%+ for all public functions
- **Scope**: All smart contracts in `contracts/` directory
- **Tools**: Hardhat, Foundry, Mocha/Chai

#### Test Categories:
- **Role-based Access Control**: Test all role requirements and restrictions
- **zkSync Integration**: Test permit, deposit/withdraw, exit functions
- **Paymaster Functions**: Test validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction, postTransaction
- **Governance**: Test voting, proposal creation, execution
- **Staking**: Test staking, unstaking, rewards calculation
- **Oracle**: Test data updates, validation, access control
- **Bridge**: Test cross-chain operations, security checks

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Cross-module interactions**: Token + Staking + Governance
- **zkSync + Paymaster integration**: End-to-end gas fee payment flow
- **Oracle + Governance**: Data-driven governance decisions
- **Bridge + Token**: Cross-chain token transfers

### 3. Edge Case Testing
- **Overflow/Underflow**: Test with maximum/minimum values
- **Reentrancy**: Test all external calls for reentrancy vulnerabilities
- **Access Control**: Test unauthorized access attempts
- **State Consistency**: Test concurrent operations

### 4. Fuzzing Testing
- **Random Input Testing**: Use Foundry fuzz for random inputs
- **Property-based Testing**: Test invariants and properties
- **Mutation Testing**: Test with slightly modified inputs

## Manual Testing Methodology

### 1. Attack Vectors to Test

#### Role-based Attacks:
- **Role Escalation**: Attempt to gain higher privileges
- **Role Bypass**: Try to call restricted functions without proper roles
- **Role Confusion**: Test role assignment/revocation logic

#### Governance Attacks:
- **Vote Manipulation**: Test quadratic voting edge cases
- **Proposal Gaming**: Test proposal creation/execution timing
- **Treasury Drain**: Test treasury access and fund management

#### Token Attacks:
- **Minting Abuse**: Test minting limits and access control
- **Transfer Bypass**: Test anti-whale and blacklist mechanisms
- **Fee Manipulation**: Test fee calculation and collection

#### zkSync Specific Attacks:
- **Exit Race Conditions**: Test L2→L1 exit timing
- **Paymaster Abuse**: Test gas fee payment manipulation
- **Permit Replay**: Test EIP-2612 permit replay attacks
- **CREATE2 Collision**: Test address collision attacks

#### Oracle Attacks:
- **Data Manipulation**: Test oracle data validation
- **Access Control**: Test oracle update permissions
- **Stale Data**: Test data freshness requirements

### 2. Logical Flaws to Check
- **Mathematical Errors**: Check all calculations for precision
- **State Inconsistencies**: Test concurrent state modifications
- **Timing Issues**: Test time-based functions and deadlines
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Test gas limits and storage constraints

## Bug Bounty Program

### Program Overview
- **Platform**: HackerOne (recommended) or self-hosted
- **Scope**: All Halom smart contracts and offchain scripts
- **Duration**: Continuous program
- **Budget**: $50,000+ annually

### Scope Definition

#### In Scope:
- All smart contracts in `contracts/` directory
- Offchain scripts in `offchain-scripts/`
- Governance mechanisms
- Staking and reward systems
- Oracle data feeds
- Bridge functionality
- zkSync integration
- Paymaster functionality

#### Out of Scope:
- Third-party libraries (OpenZeppelin, etc.)
- Infrastructure and deployment scripts
- Documentation and README files
- Test files (unless they contain production logic)

### Reward Structure

#### Critical Severity ($10,000 - $25,000):
- Complete system compromise
- Unauthorized admin access
- Fund theft or permanent loss
- Complete governance takeover
- Critical zkSync integration flaw

#### High Severity ($2,000 - $10,000):
- Role escalation to admin
- Significant fund loss (recoverable)
- Governance manipulation
- Oracle manipulation
- Bridge security flaw

#### Medium Severity ($500 - $2,000):
- Partial fund loss
- DoS attacks
- Information disclosure
- Logic flaws
- Access control bypass

#### Low Severity ($100 - $500):
- Minor bugs
- Gas optimization issues
- Documentation errors
- UI/UX issues

### Rules of Engagement

#### Allowed Activities:
- Testing on testnet only
- Automated scanning tools
- Manual testing and exploitation
- Social engineering (with permission)

#### Prohibited Activities:
- Testing on mainnet
- Causing service disruption
- Accessing other users' data
- Physical attacks
- Social engineering without permission

#### Safe Harbor:
- Good faith security research is protected
- No legal action for responsible disclosure
- Recognition in security hall of fame
- Public disclosure after fix (with permission)

## Testing Tools and Workflow
