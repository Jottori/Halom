# Secure Role Structure Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the secure role structure for the Halom ecosystem, ensuring proper role separation, governance controls, and anti-whale protection as specified in the requirements.

## Role Definitions and Assignments

### 🔐 DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
**Purpose**: Ultimate admin authority in all contracts
**Permissions**: All other role assignments and modifications
**Assignment**: 
- ✅ **TimelockController** - Only timelock gets this role
- ❌ **Never individual wallets**
- ❌ **Never multisig directly**

**Security**: All critical modifications require timelock delay and governance approval.

### 🪙 MINTER_ROLE
**Purpose**: Token minting (new token issuance)
**Permissions**: `HalomToken.mint()`
**Assignment**:
- ✅ **HalomStaking contract** - For rebase reward distribution
- ❌ **Never human addresses**
- ❌ **Never multisig wallets**
- ❌ **Never use DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for minting**

**Implementation**: 
- Minting only allowed during rebase operations
- Internal minting for rebase rewards
- External minting restricted to authorized contracts only
- **CRITICAL**: Use MINTER_ROLE, not DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for staking contracts
- **CRITICAL**: Required for rebase rewards to be distributed to staking contract

**Security Note**: 
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` has full administrative privileges including parameter changes
- `MINTER_ROLE` only allows minting, which is the minimum required permission
- Always use the principle of least privilege

### 🔁 REBASE_CALLER
**Purpose**: Trigger HalomToken rebase operations
**Permissions**: `HalomToken.rebase()`
**Assignment**:
- ✅ **HalomOracleV2 contract** - Only oracle can trigger rebase
- ❌ **Never human addresses**

**Security**: Oracle contract only updatable through DAO governance.

### 📈 ORACLE_UPDATER_ROLE
**Purpose**: Submit HOI index values to oracle
**Permissions**: `HalomOracleV2.submitHOI()`
**Assignment**:
- ✅ **Authorized Oracle Node contracts** - Multiple independent nodes
- ✅ **Consensus mechanism** - Threshold signature or aggregator
- ❌ **Never multisig or individuals**

**Implementation**:
- Multi-node consensus system
- Minimum 3 oracle nodes required
- Consensus threshold of 2 nodes
- Maximum 5% deviation between submissions

### 🧑‍⚖️ GOVERNOR_ROLE
**Purpose**: Governance functions and parameter management
**Permissions**:
- `HalomStaking.slash()`
- Parameter configuration
- Emergency functions
**Assignment**:
- ✅ **HalomGovernor contract** - DAO governance contract
- ✅ **TimelockController** - For time-delayed execution

**Security**: All governance actions require timelock delay and community voting.

### ⚔️ SLASHER_ROLE
**Purpose**: Execute slashing (penalties)
**Permissions**: `HalomStaking.slash()`
**Assignment**:
- ✅ **GOVERNOR_ROLE holders** - Only DAO can slash
- ❌ **Never validators or rewarders**

**Implementation**: 
- Off-chain proof required for slashing
- No automated slashing
- 50% default slash percentage (configurable)

### 🎁 REWARDER_ROLE
**Purpose**: Add reward tokens to staking contracts
**Permissions**: `addReward()` in staking contracts
**Assignment**:
- ✅ **HalomToken contract** - For rebase rewards
- ✅ **Governor contract** - For governance-controlled rewards
- ❌ **Never user addresses**

**Security**: Reward tokens only distributable through governance decisions.

### 🔒 STAKING_CONTRACT_ROLE
**Purpose**: Token burning (slash execution)
**Permissions**: `HalomToken.burnFrom()`
**Assignment**:
- ✅ **HalomStaking contract only**
- ❌ **No other contracts or addresses**

**Security**: Fixed after deployment, no further modifications allowed.

**Critical Setup**:
- Must be set via `setStakingContract()` during deployment
- Required for slash functionality to work
- Automatically grants STAKING_CONTRACT_ROLE to the specified address

### 🧾 TREASURY_CONTROLLER
**Purpose**: Treasury fund management
**Permissions**: 
- `withdrawTreasuryFunds()`
- `distributeFees()`
**Assignment**:
- ✅ **Governor contract** - DAO controlled
- ❌ **Never direct human control**

**Security**: All treasury operations require governance approval and timelock delay.

## Anti-Whale and Decentralization Features

### 🛡️ Fourth Root Governance
- **Voting Power**: `root(staked_tokens)` instead of linear
- **Effect**: Smaller stakes get relatively more voting power
- **Implementation**: Babylonian method for fourth root calculation

### ⏰ Time-Locked Staking
- **Lock Period**: 30 days minimum
- **Booster**: Longer locks get governance power multiplier
- **Anti-Whale**: Prevents rapid accumulation and dumping

### 🚫 Transfer Limits
- **Max Transfer**: 1% of total supply
- **Max Wallet**: 2% of total supply
- **Exclusions**: Contracts, governance, oracle addresses

### 🏛️ Governance Controls
- **Timelock Delay**: 24 hours minimum
- **Voting Period**: Configurable through governance
- **Quorum**: Fourth root based quorum requirements

## Oracle Federation Security

### 🔗 Multi-Node Consensus
- **Minimum Nodes**: 3 oracle nodes
- **Consensus Threshold**: 2/3 agreement
- **Deviation Limit**: 5% maximum between submissions
- **Submission Window**: 5 minutes per round

### 🛡️ Oracle Node Management
- **Authorization**: Only through governance
- **Rotation**: Regular node rotation mechanism
- **Penalties**: Slashing for malicious behavior
- **Redundancy**: Multiple independent data sources

## Contract Security Measures

### 🔐 Role Manager Contract
```solidity
contract HalomRoleManager {
    // Prevents direct role grants/revokes
    function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) public override {
        revert("Use grantRoleToContract for contracts or specific functions for humans");
    }
    
    // Contract-only role assignment
    function grantRoleToContract(bytes32 role, address contractAddress) external onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE)
}
```

### 🚨 Emergency Functions
- **Pause Mechanism**: Emergency pause for all contracts
- **Recovery Functions**: Emergency token recovery
- **Role Freezing**: Ability to freeze role assignments
- **Emergency Consensus**: Governor can force oracle consensus

### 📊 Monitoring and Alerts
- **Role Assignment Tracking**: All role changes logged
- **Event Emission**: Comprehensive event logging
- **Off-chain Monitoring**: Real-time alert system
- **Health Checks**: Automated contract health monitoring
