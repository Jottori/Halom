# Halom Architecture

## Overview

Halom is a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem built on Ethereum that includes governance, staking, oracle services, and cross-chain bridge functionality. The architecture is designed with modularity, security, and scalability in mind.

## Core Components

### 1. Token System (`contracts/token/`)
- **HalomToken.sol**: Main ERC20 token with rebase mechanics, anti-whale protection, and governance voting capabilities
- Features: Anti-whale limits, rebase logic, emergency controls, role-based access control

### 2. Governance System (`contracts/governance/`)
- **Governance.sol**: Main governance contract implementing quadratic voting and proposal management
- **QuadraticVotingUtils.sol**: Utility functions for quadratic voting calculations
- **Timelock.sol**: Time-delayed execution mechanism for governance proposals

### 3. Staking System (`contracts/staking/`)
- **Staking.sol**: Main staking contract for token staking and rewards
- **LPStaking.sol**: Liquidity provider staking with additional rewards

### 4. Oracle System (`contracts/oracle/`)
- **Oracle.sol**: Decentralized oracle providing economic data feeds
- Supports multiple data sources and aggregation methods

### 5. Bridge System (`contracts/bridge/`)
- Cross-chain bridge functionality for multi-chain interoperability
- Secure asset transfer between different blockchain networks

### 6. Utility System (`contracts/utils/`)
- **AntiWhale.sol**: Anti-whale protection mechanisms
- **FeeOnTransfer.sol**: Transfer fee management
- **Blacklist.sol**: Address blacklisting functionality
- **Treasury.sol**: Treasury management and fund allocation

### 7. Library System (`contracts/libraries/`)
- **GovernanceErrors.sol**: Error definitions for governance contracts
- **GovernanceMath.sol**: Mathematical utilities for governance calculations

### 8. Test System (`contracts/test/`)
- **MockERC20.sol**: Mock ERC20 token for testing
- **TestProxy.sol**: Test proxy contract for upgradeable contracts

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Timelock delays for governance actions

### Anti-Whale Protection
- Transfer amount limits
- Wallet balance limits
- Excludable addresses for special cases

### Emergency Controls
- Emergency pause functionality
- Blacklist management
- Emergency role permissions

## Integration Points

### Governance Integration
- Token holders can participate in governance
- Quadratic voting ensures fair representation
- Timelock ensures proposal execution safety

### Staking Integration
- Staking rewards from token rebase
- LP staking for additional incentives
- Treasury integration for reward distribution

### Oracle Integration
- Economic data feeds for governance decisions
- Real-time market data integration
- Multi-source data aggregation

## Deployment Architecture

### Network Support
