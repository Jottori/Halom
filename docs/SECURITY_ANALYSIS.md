# üîí Security Analysis Pipeline

This document describes the comprehensive security analysis pipeline integrated into the Halom Protocol project.

## Overview

The security analysis pipeline includes multiple tools and techniques to ensure the highest level of security for smart contracts and offchain components:

- **Slither**: Static analysis for Solidity contracts
- **Manticore**: Symbolic execution and vulnerability detection
- **MythX**: Automated vulnerability detection via API
- **Fuzzing Tests**: Property-based testing and edge case discovery
- **Coverage Analysis**: Test coverage measurement and reporting

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Overview

### 1. Slither (Static Analysis)

**Purpose**: Static analysis tool that detects vulnerabilities and enforces coding standards.

**Features**:
- Detects common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)
- Enforces coding standards
- Generates call graphs and inheritance graphs
- Supports SARIF output for GitHub integration

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run Slither analysis
npm run security:slither

# Or directly
slither . --config slither.config.json
```

**Configuration**: See `slither.config.json` for custom settings.

### 2. Manticore (Symbolic Execution)

**Purpose**: Symbolic execution engine for vulnerability discovery.

**Features**:
- Symbolic execution of smart contracts
- Automatic vulnerability detection
- Path exploration and constraint solving
- Support for complex attack scenarios

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run Manticore analysis
npm run security:manticore

# Or directly
python .github/scripts/manticore_analysis.py
```

### 3. MythX (Automated Analysis)

**Purpose**: Cloud-based automated vulnerability detection.

**Features**:
- Advanced static analysis

**Setup**:
1. Get a MythX API key from [mythx.io](https://mythx.io)
2. Add to GitHub Secrets as `MYTHX_API_KEY`
3. Run analysis:
```bash
npm run security:mythx
```

### 4. Fuzzing Tests

**Purpose**: Property-based testing and edge case discovery.

**Features**:
- Integer overflow/underflow testing
- Reentrancy attack simulation
- Access control testing
- Gas optimization analysis

python .github/scripts/fuzzing_tests.py
```

### 5. Coverage Analysis

**Purpose**: Test coverage measurement and reporting.

**Features**:

- HTML and JSON output formats

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run coverage analysis
npm run security:coverage

# Or directly
python .github/scripts/coverage_report.py
```

6. **Security Summary**:
   - `security_summary.json` - Combined results
   - `security_summary.md` - Comprehensive report
   - Security badges for README

### Security Badges

The pipeline generates security badges for your README:

```markdown
![Security Score](https://img.shields.io/badge/Security%20Score-A+-brightgreen)
![Vulnerabilities](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vulnerabilities-0-brightgreen)
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-85%25-brightgreen)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Slither Configuration

Edit `slither.config.json` to customize:
- Detectors to exclude
- Severity levels to report
- Output formats
- Filter paths

### Environment Variables

Set these in GitHub Secrets:
- `MYTHX_API_KEY` - MythX API key for cloud analysis

### Customization

Each analysis script can be customized:
- `.github/scripts/manticore_analysis.py` - Manticore settings
- `.github/scripts/mythx_analysis.py` - MythX configuration
- `.github/scripts/fuzzing_tests.py` - Fuzzing parameters
- `.github/scripts/coverage_report.py` - Coverage thresholds

## üìà Security Score Calculation

The overall security score (0-100) is calculated based on:

- **Vulnerabilities**: Deducts points for findings
  - Critical: -20 points each
  - High: -10 points each
  - Medium: -5 points each
  - Low: -1 point each

- **Coverage Bonus**: Adds points for good coverage
  - ‚â•80%: +10 points
  - ‚â•70%: +5 points

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Run Security Analysis Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run security:all
   ```

2. **Check Coverage Before Committing**:
   ```bash
   npm run security:coverage
   ```

3. **Review Security Reports**:
   - Check generated markdown reports
   - Address high/critical findings
   - Improve test coverage

### For Security Reviewers

1. **Review All Analysis Results**:
   - Slither findings
   - Manticore vulnerabilities
   - MythX issues
   - Fuzzing test failures

2. **Focus on High/Critical Issues**:
   - Prioritize by severity
   - Verify false positives
   - Document findings

3. **Monitor Coverage Trends**:
   - Track coverage over time
   - Ensure new code is tested
   - Maintain coverage targets

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MythX API Errors**:
   - Check API key in GitHub Secrets
   - Verify API quota and limits
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Manticore Timeouts**:
   - Increase timeout in script
   - Reduce analysis scope
   - Use smaller contracts

3. **Coverage Issues**:
   - Ensure tests are running
   - Check coverage configuration
   - Verify file paths
