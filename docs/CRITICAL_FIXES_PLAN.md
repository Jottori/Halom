    function execute(
        address[] memory targets,
        uint256[] memory values,
        bytes[] memory calldatas,
        bytes32 descriptionHash
    ) public payable override nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Add additional validation
        require(targets.length > 0, "No targets provided");
        require(targets.length == values.length, "Length mismatch");
        require(targets.length == calldatas.length, "Length mismatch");
        
        return super.execute(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash);
    }
}
```

### 2. **Input Validation Enhancement**
**Status:** PENDING  
**Deadline:** Day 5

```solidity
// HalomOracle.sol
function setHOI(uint256 _hoi, uint256 _nonce) external onlyRole(ORACLE_UPDATER_ROLE) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    require(_hoi > 0, "HOI must be positive");
    require(_hoi <= MAX_HOI_VALUE, "HOI exceeds maximum");
    require(_nonce == nonce, "Invalid nonce");
    
    // Rate limiting
    require(block.timestamp >= lastUpdateTime + MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL, "Update too frequent");
    
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Deadline:** Day 10  

**Actions:**

**Code Changes:**
```solidity
// HalomOracle.sol
contract HalomOracle is AccessControl, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard {
    uint256 public constant MAX_HOI_DEVIATION = 50; // 50% max deviation
    uint256 public constant ORACLE_HEARTBEAT = 1 hours;
    
    function setHOI(uint256 _hoi, uint256 _nonce) external onlyRole(ORACLE_UPDATER_ROLE) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        // Deviation check
        if (latestHOI > 0) {
            uint256 deviation = _calculateDeviation(latestHOI, _hoi);
            require(deviation <= MAX_HOI_DEVIATION, "HOI deviation too high");
        }
        
        // Heartbeat check
        require(block.timestamp <= lastUpdateTime + ORACLE_HEARTBEAT, "Oracle heartbeat exceeded");
        
        // ... rest of function
    }
}
```

### 2. **Governance Security Enhancements**
