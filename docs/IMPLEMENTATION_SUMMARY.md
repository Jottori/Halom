## 3. Governance Roles Implementation

### Architecture
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Comprehensive permission system
- **Time-Limited Roles**: Automatic role expiration
- **Multisig Support**: Multi-signature consensus
- **Emergency Controls**: Emergency override capabilities

### Role Hierarchy
```solidity
// Role Structure
DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE     - Ultimate control (multisig only)
GOVERNOR_ROLE          - DAO governance execution
REBASE_CALLER_ROLE     - Rebase operations (time-limited)
REWARDER_ROLE          - Reward distribution (time-limited)
EMERGENCY_ROLE         - Emergency controls
MULTISIG_ROLE          - Multisig consensus operations
```

### Security Features
- **Stake Requirements**: Minimum stake for sensitive roles
- **Time Limits**: Automatic expiration for temporary roles
