## Program Overview

The Halom Protocol Bug Bounty Program is designed to incentivize security researchers and white hat hackers to identify vulnerabilities in our smart contract ecosystem before they can be exploited maliciously. We believe in the power of community-driven security and are committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our users.

### What is Halom Protocol?
Halom Protocol is a comprehensive DAO governance and DeFi ecosystem featuring:
- **Governance:** Quadratic voting, delegation, proposal management
- **Tokenomics:** Rebase mechanism, anti-whale protections, staking rewards
- **Oracle:** HOI (Happiness of Index) calculation and integration
- **Treasury:** Multi-signature controlled fund management
- **Staking:** LP and token staking with reward distribution

## Reward Tiers

### Critical Severity - Up to $100,000
**Impact:** Complete protocol compromise, fund loss, or governance takeover

**Examples:**
- Direct fund theft from treasury or staking contracts
- Complete governance bypass allowing malicious proposals
- Oracle manipulation leading to massive token inflation/deflation
- Reentrancy allowing unlimited token minting
- Access control bypass allowing admin takeover

### High Severity - Up to $50,000
**Impact:** Significant fund loss, major functionality disruption

**Examples:**
- Partial fund theft or manipulation
- Governance manipulation affecting voting power
- Staking reward manipulation
- Oracle manipulation affecting rebase calculations
- Flash loan attacks on governance or staking

### Medium Severity - Up to $10,000
**Impact:** Moderate fund loss, functionality disruption

**Examples:**
- Small fund theft or manipulation
- Minor governance issues
- Staking calculation errors
- Oracle precision issues
- Gas optimization vulnerabilities

### Low Severity - Up to $1,000
**Impact:** Minor issues, edge cases, informational

**Examples:**
- Edge case handling issues

- Non-critical logic errors

### Gas Optimization - Up to $500
**Impact:** Gas efficiency improvements

**Examples:**
- Significant gas savings in frequently called functions
