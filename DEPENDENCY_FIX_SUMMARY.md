# Dependency Fix Summary - OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Initial Version Issue
**Problem**: `npm error notarget No matching version found for @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades@^1.35.0`

**Root Cause**: The `package.json` file specified version `^1.35.0` which doesn't exist on npm. According to the [npm package information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades), the latest version is **3.9.0**.

### 2. Peer Dependency Conflict
**Problem**: `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades@3.9.0 requires @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers@^3.0.0 (peer dependency)`

**Root Cause**: Version incompatibility between `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers@^4.0.0` and `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades@^3.9.0`.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Package Dependencies

**Files Modified**: `package.json`

**Changes Made**:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^5.0.1"  // Updated from ^4.9.3
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers": "^3.0.0",  // Downgraded from ^4.0.0
    "@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades": "^3.9.0"    // Updated from ^1.35.0
  }
}
```

**Resolution Strategy**: Used **Version Alignment** (recommended approach from [npm dependency resolution best practices](https://medium.com/@robert.maiersilldorff/resolving-npm-peer-dependency-conflicts-70d67f4ca7dc)) to satisfy peer dependency requirements.

### 2. Updated Hardhat Configuration

**Files Modified**: `hardhat.config.js`

**Changes Made**:
```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require('@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades');  // Added plugin registration
require('dotenv').config();
```

### 3. Added Upgrade Scripts

**Files Created**: `scripts/upgrade_contracts.js`

**Features**:
- Comprehensive upgrade script for all Halom Protocol contracts
- Error handling and validation
- Upgrade history tracking
- Network-specific deployment support

**Scripts Added to package.json**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "upgrade:contracts": "npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade_contracts.js --network localhost",
    "upgrade:testnet": "npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade_contracts.js --network zkSyncTestnet",
    "test:governance": "npx hardhat test test/test-governance.js"
  }
}
```

### 4. Created Comprehensive Documentation

**Files Created**: 
- `docs/upgrades.md` - Complete upgrade guide
- `docs/npm-dependency-resolution.md` - Dependency conflict resolution guide

**Content**:
- Complete guide for using OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades plugin
- UUPS proxy pattern explanation
- Upgrade safety guidelines
- Governance integration
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- NPM dependency conflict resolution strategies

## Dependency Resolution Strategy

### Why Version Alignment Was Chosen

Based on [best practices for resolving npm dependency conflicts](https://dev.to/gentritbiba/understanding-and-resolving-npm-dependency-conflicts-a-developers-guide-3c33), we chose **Version Alignment** over other strategies:

1. **✅ Version Alignment** (Chosen) - Align package versions to satisfy peer dependency requirements
2. **❌ Legacy Peer Dependencies** - Can lead to compatibility issues
3. **❌ Force Installation** - Bypasses all dependency checks
4. **❌ Dependency Overrides** - Not necessary for this case

### Compatibility Matrix

| Package | Version | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades | ^3.9.0 | Latest stable version |
| @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers | ^3.0.0 | Peer dependency requirement |
| @openzeppelin/contracts | ^5.0.1 | Latest stable version |
| ethers | ^6.14.4 | Compatible with hardhat-ethers v3 |
| hardhat | ^2.22.1 | Compatible with all dependencies |

## OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades Plugin Features

### Key Capabilities

1. **Automatic Validation**: Validates upgrade safety and storage compatibility
2. **Proxy Management**: Handles UUPS, transparent, and beacon proxy patterns
3. **Implementation Tracking**: Tracks implementation contracts in `.openzeppelin` folder
4. **Gas Optimization**: Reuses implementation contracts when possible
5. **Network Support**: Works across all supported networks

### Supported Proxy Patterns

1. **UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)**
   - Most gas-efficient
   - Upgrade logic in implementation contract
   - Recommended for Halom Protocol

2. **Transparent Proxy**
   - Traditional proxy pattern
   - Admin contract manages upgrades
   - Higher gas costs

3. **Beacon Proxy**
   - Multiple proxies share same implementation
   - Atomic upgrades across all proxies
   - Useful for factory patterns

## Usage Examples

### Initial Deployment

```javascript
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const HalomToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("HalomToken");
    
    const token = await upgrades.deployProxy(HalomToken, [
        oracleAddress,
        governanceAddress
    ]);
    
    await token.deployed();
    console.log("HalomToken deployed to:", token.address);
}
```

### Contract Upgrade

```javascript
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const HalomTokenV2 = await ethers.getContractFactory("HalomTokenV2");
    
    const upgradedToken = await upgrades.upgradeProxy(
        existingTokenAddress,
        HalomTokenV2
    );
    
    console.log("Token upgraded successfully");
}
```

### Testing Upgrades

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("HalomToken Upgrade", function() {
    it('should upgrade successfully', async () => {
        const HalomToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("HalomToken");
        const token = await upgrades.deployProxy(HalomToken, [oracle, governance]);
        
        const HalomTokenV2 = await ethers.getContractFactory("HalomTokenV2");
        const upgradedToken = await upgrades.upgradeProxy(token.address, HalomTokenV2);
        
        expect(await upgradedToken.version()).to.equal("2.0.0");
    });
});
```

## Available Commands

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Upgrade Scripts
```bash
# Upgrade contracts on localhost
npm run upgrade:contracts

# Upgrade contracts on testnet
npm run upgrade:testnet

# Manual upgrade command
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade_contracts.js --network <network>
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run governance tests (includes upgrade tests)
npm run test:governance

# Run all tests
npm test
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control
- Only authorized addresses can upgrade contracts
- Use role-based access control
- Consider multi-signature requirements

### 2. Storage Safety
- Plugin validates storage layout compatibility
- Don't change existing state variables
- Only add new variables at the end

### 3. Governance Integration
- Use timelock for production upgrades
- Require community approval for major changes
- Maintain upgrade history

### 4. Testing
- Test all upgrades thoroughly
- Use multiple test networks
- Simulate production conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Peer Dependency Conflicts**
   - **Solution**: Use version alignment strategy
   - **Example**: Downgrade `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers` to `^3.0.0`

2. **Storage Layout Incompatibility**
   - **Error**: "New storage layout is incompatible"
   - **Solution**: Check variable order and types

3. **Authorization Error**
   - **Error**: "AccessControl: account is missing role"
   - **Solution**: Ensure caller has DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE

4. **Initialization Error**
   - **Error**: "Contract is already initialized"
   - **Solution**: Use `reinitializer` for reinitialization

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check contract validation
npx hardhat compile

# Validate upgrade safety
npx hardhat run scripts/validate_upgrade.js

# Check proxy info
npx hardhat run scripts/check_proxy.js

# Check dependency tree
