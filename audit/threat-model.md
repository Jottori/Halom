function attack() external {
    // 1. Flash loan large amount
    flashLoan(1000000);
    
    // 2. Use borrowed funds to vote
    governance.castVote(proposalId, 1);
    
    // 3. Execute malicious proposal
    governance.execute(targets, values, calldatas);
    
    // 4. Repay flash loan with stolen funds
    repayFlashLoan();
}
